rapidsms-reports
================

Welcome to the documentation for rapidsms-reports!

After creating `rapidsms-nutrition <https://github.com/caktus/rapidsms-nutrition>`_
and `rapidsms-appointments <https://github.com/caktus/rapidsms-appointments>`_
for the 1000 Days project, we started to see that many applications rely on
the idea of a report between a patient and a provider. This application is
intended to provide a common framework on which to build other 1000 Days
applications.

Running the Tests
-----------------

You can run the tests with via::

    python setup.py test
